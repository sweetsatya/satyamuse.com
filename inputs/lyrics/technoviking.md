# Technoviking

I don't know what to make of it
It's all happening too fast
A new model in another week
While the rest of us just gasp

We are entering a new age
Do we rush or hesitate?
There are pitfalls on this new stage
Who will help us navigate?

Here comes the technoviking
He like running, he likes biking
Making maps in latent spaces
Finding beauty and new faces

Here comes the technoviking
He likes yoga, he likes hiking
While he sleeps, machines are running
Finding patterns that are stunning
Stunning

Techno techno technoviking
Techno techno technoviking
Techno techno technoviking
Techno techno technoviking

Are we rushing to our final end
Or is this another start?
There's no time for us to pretend
That we have the leading part

Let's accept the truth with dignity
That our mind is not unique
We are nestled in infinity
And have not reached our peak

Will we find that which we seek?

Here comes the technoviking
He like running, he likes biking
Making maps in latent spaces
Finding beauty and new faces

Here comes the technoviking
He likes yoga, he likes hiking
While he sleeps, machines are running
Finding patterns that are stunning
Stunning

Techno techno technoviking
Techno techno technoviking
Techno techno technoviking
Techno techno technoviking
