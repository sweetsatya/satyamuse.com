# Lila

Veil after veil after veil after veil
Round and round and round we go
Up and down and up and down
Left and right and upside down
Apsaras dancing in the wind
Rudra’s breath has been perceived

Birth after death after birth after death
Round and round and round we go
In and out and in and out
I’m within and I’m without
Life goes on and life goes out
It’s eternal, there’s no doubt

Wave after wave after wave after wave
Round and round and round we go
Up and down and up and down
In a spiral we go down
Then go up to see God’s face
This is our share of Grace

Play after play after play after play
Round and round and round we go
Dark and light and dark and light
In their never-ending fight
It is sorrow and delight
Just accept that you are light

Veil after veil after veil after veil
Birth after death after birth after death
Wave after wave after wave after wave
Play after play after play after play
Round and round and round we go
