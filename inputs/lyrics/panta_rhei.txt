# Panta Rhei

When Heraclitus was a young man
Playing asyq
By the temple of Artemis
He realized 
That the world was made of
Everliving fire
He left his family in Ephesus
And traveled by foot
To explore the world
While questioning himself on his way
To eternal Truth

Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows
Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows
Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows
Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows

He witnessed tension in apparent harmony
Of opposites
That are one indeed
And that in our need for security
We wish for constancy
In sight, in deed
Yet all things scatter and come together
Approach and then recede
So it is futile to hold on to the past
And this moment will not repeat

You canâ€™t step into the same river twice

Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows
Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows
Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows
Panta rhei, panta rhei
Everything flows
